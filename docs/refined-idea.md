# Refined Concept: Personal Website

## Audience Segments
- Recruiters evaluating fit, impact, and seniority quickly.
- Hiring managers validating architecture depth and delivery ownership.
- Senior engineers and tech leads assessing practical expertise in backend systems at scale.

## Brand Voice Rules
- Confident: communicate outcomes and decisions clearly.
- Practical: focus on real architecture tradeoffs and measurable impact.
- Friendly: stay approachable and human without sounding casual to the point of being vague.
- Non-hype: avoid exaggerated claims and keep statements evidence-based.

## Content Pillars
- Backend at scale: distributed systems, API design, reliability, and performance.
- Cloud architecture: production deployments, observability, cost-awareness, and resiliency patterns.
- Engineering leadership: ownership, mentoring, execution planning, and cross-team alignment.
- Personal interests: curated lifestyle and learning moments that reinforce a grounded, balanced persona.

## Visual Direction
- Theme: black/white/grayscale with strong contrast and deliberate typography.

## Privacy Boundary
- Public content stays professional-first.
- Do not explicitly name private friends or sensitive relationships in public-facing copy.
- Keep personal storytelling contextual and non-invasive.

## Image Policy
- MVP1 uses curated placeholders and AI-generated assets where needed.
- Gallery captions clarify context without exposing private details.
- Real/final personal media is swapped in progressively after launch.
